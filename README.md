## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend Technologies**

- Next.js Framework: An open-source React framework used for building server-rendered web applications.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors during development and improves code quality.
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript applications, utilized here to manage the global state for the shopping cart and address form.
- Stripe: A popular payment processing platform that ensures secure and reliable online transactions.

### **Backend Technologies**

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database offering flexibility and scalability for storing and retrieving data.
- NextAuth: A flexible authentication library used in the backend with Next.js, providing various authentication methods and integrations.

### **Development Tools and Libraries**

- Formik - A popular library for building forms in React
- Yup - A JavaScript validation library
- Styled Components: A library for writing CSS-in-JS, allowing for styling React components with ease and flexibility.

## **What I Learned**

Some of the key takeaways from this project include:

- Redux: I gained proficiency in using Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It allowed me to manage the global state efficiently, providing a centralized data store for the shopping cart and address form in this project.
- TypeScript: I learned how to use TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript helped me catch errors during development and improve code quality by providing type checking and better tooling support.
- Styled Components: I explored the usage of Styled Components, a library for writing CSS-in-JS. It enabled me to create and manage component-specific styles, improving modularity and reusability of styles within the project.
- Stripe: I integrated Stripe, a popular payment processing platform, into the application. By working with Stripe, I gained experience in handling secure and reliable online transactions, ensuring a smooth payment flow for users.
- Building a Full-Stack Application: I successfully developed a full-stack web application using Next.js as the primary framework for both frontend (including SSR and SSG) and backend (utilizing NextAuth for authentication). This experience enhanced my understanding of building scalable and efficient applications using a unified technology stack.

Throughout this project, the hands-on experience in building a full-stack application using these technologies has further strengthened my proficiency as a developer.

## **Roadmap for Future Development**

Some potential features that will be added in the future include:

- Optimizing website performance to ensure faster loading times and smoother user experience.
- Adding an Admin Dashboard to monitor and manage orders, providing an efficient backend interface for order tracking and management.
